# Uncomplicating the complicated The Breakdown of Internet Jargons

Wellcome to the journey of simplifying the internet jargons of the internet via the simple analogies/ examples 

## HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

let's break these into smaller chuncks first 


### Protocol 

Protocol is nothing but set of rules/procedures/processes that are ment to perform specific task 

eg : if you enter a hotel the host of the hotel arranges a table for you and a waiter takes your order passes it to the chef and when the food is prepared it is given back to you and when you are done with your meal then waiter gets you your check 

### HyperText 

HyperText is just a text document,web page that has links (you can call it as references that support the statement or give credits to original writer) to the other texts and may have links to other text document so on 

so now let's combine the above two topics to explain HTTP

HTTP is a method where a text document,web page is transfered from one computer to other computer as per specified set of rules

## TLS (Transport Layer Security) 

It is one the additional protocol which is added into the HTTPS/2 it simply encrypts the sensitive information that is being sent to server from the client 

TLS Anology : A sealed tape on product packet so that none of the malicious persons can't know what is inside the product  

## User Agent 

It can be assumed as software application that acts like user on the commands of user to send and recive information over the internet 

user agent Analogy example: A travel agent when you call a travel agent to book a tickets all the headache of having tickets in you name is no his headache 

## TCP (Transmission control protocol)

As the name it self suggest that the set of rules over which information is sent from one system to another

TCP Analogy : A power grid system in which voltage current is diffrent at diffrent points and diffrent users eg: for resdential users electricity voltage is 230v single phase and depending on stage of electricity transmission diffrent voltage is present 

## FTP (File Transmission protocol)

Just like TCP a set of rules over which diffrent types files are sent 

FTP Analogy : when you order from amazon if there is a delicate item then rule is to bubble wrap it, if it is a icecream then rule is to send it via cold trucks

## IP Address(Internet Protocol)

It is unique identification given to a to a device that wants to connect to the internet 

IP Address Analogy : when you want to send a letter to some one via the postal services you send it via city name street name and house number and person name

## URL (Universal Resource Locater)

it is a memorable name given to the IP address of the website service so that reaching that is easy


## DNS (Domain Name System)

It is a system where URL that is linked to IP of a website is stored and does the job of fetching the IP of the website back to the browser to search it to the actual website

DNS Analogy: it is just like contact of an individual when you want to give him a call jou just search for the person in the contact and copy the phone no of the person in order to call him

## Header 

It is addtional information or just data about the data of the system and may be its hardware

Header Analogy: when you want to corrier some package the outer cover is Header 
## Payload

It is the actual data that you want to send it to the server form the client to perform operation intended by the User Agent

Payload Analogy : Immagine a sattlite that is launched by the rocket in to an orbit to gather the data about the celestial object 

## cache 

It is data that is stored in the browser in order make things quicker to the User Agent When he visits the same website service next time

Cache Analogy: when your home is far but you don't want to carry you cricket kit for tommorws match so you place it in your kit in you nearby friends home

## Cookies 

It is nothing but a kind of data stored in browser that enables loging in and traking the user actions on their websites in order to enhance their websites

Cookies Analogy : It is like praising cookie flavour of your aunt so next time you visit your aunt there is high probability that same flavour cookie is presented
